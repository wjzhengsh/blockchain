## {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform capabilities

{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} offerings are built on the [Hyperledger Fabric](reference/v10_fabric.html) code base that leverages a modular architecture to achieve enterprise levels of security, data integrity, scalability, and performance to meet your business needs.

{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform provides a highly secure and permissioned blockchain network, upon which authenticated members can easily define assets and create the business solutions for modifying and exchanging them. With {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform offerings, you can take advantage of an orchestration framework that allows you to **quickly organize your consortium into an active blockchain network**. {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform provides friendly tooling that is designed to make it simple for multiple institutions to join together and create a democratically governed network. The creation, governance, and operation tasks of the network become intuitive and transparent through a built-in dashboard monitor and provisioned utilities. By foregoing the otherwise cumbersome process of creating a network and implementing governance, consortium members can instead **focus on the deployment of smart contracts and transfer of assets and information**.

**High availability** for the integral resources of the network (peers, orderers, Certificate Authorities) eliminates the crippling effects that can arise from single points of failure. A built-in dashboard monitor allows for easy management of these resources and provides a powerful mechanism to visualize assets and smart contracts. *Only supported on Starter and Enterprise offerings*.

The **modularity** of the Hyperledger Fabric architecture and the distinct separation of network roles provide an infrastructure that enables scalability and adaptability to a wide variety of use cases. *Available and supported on all {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform offerings*.

The checks and balances that occur throughout the lifecycle of a transaction ensure consistent and fully vetted results, and ledgers constantly stay synchronized through an implementation of gossip protocol. Identity and access control are easily enforced through **sign/verify** operations that occur perpetually throughout the network, which are *available and supported on all {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform offerings*.

**Governance tooling** is provided to allow members to administer and manage the critical business rules for their network. For example, you might want to implement a policy that defines how many members of a network must agree in order for a new member to join. Or perhaps there is an asset that requires endorsement from every participant in order for a modification to take place. Rules of governance are fundamental for any type of business network and are often extremely elaborate. Governance tooling (policy editors for example) greatly simplifies this process. *Only available on Starter and Enterprise offerings*.

Enterprise Plan networks run in a **highly secure and isolated** environment with no external access (including root access) to network resources. Data is encrypted in flight and at rest, and hardware security support modules allow digital keys to be protected in accordance with industry regulations. Hardware virtualization is used to run each node in an isolated environment, and therefore protecting other nodes in the network from peers with potentially misbehaving or malicious chaincode. Hashing, sign/verify operations, and node-to-node communications are accelerated thanks to advanced cryptography implementations. *Only available with Enterprise*.

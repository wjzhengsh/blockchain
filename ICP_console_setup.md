# Setting up {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private
{: #icp-console-setup}

Before you deploy {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull}} Platform components and build blockchain network on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private, you need to set up {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private in your own environment.
{:shortdesc}

## Prerequisites
{: #icp-console-setup-prerequisites}

Complete the following prerequisites and prepare your environment to install {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private.

### Docker
{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private requires Docker to be installed. Follow the related instructions in [Installing {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.2.0/installing/install.html){: external} to install Docker.

### {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private settings
Before you install {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private, the following tips are useful to prepare your nodes for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private installation. Additional {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private prerequisites can be found in the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.2.0/installing/prep.html){: external}.

#### Update `vm.max_map_count` setting
{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private uses Elastic Search for logging and metering. To avoid out-of-memory exceptions, Elastic Search requires the `vm.max_map_count` system property to be configured. Before you install {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private, see the [Elastic Search configuration instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html){: external} to configure this property on each node. You can use the following commands to set this property permanently:

```
sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144; sysctl vm.max_map_count
echo "vm.max_map_count=262144” | tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
```
{:codeblock}

#### Configure the `/etc/hosts` file on each node in your cluster

- {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private uses [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/){: external} to manage containerized applications. The Kubernetes Domain Name Server (DNS) fails if host names are not configured in the `/etc/hosts` file on each node. [Insert the IP address, hostname, and shortname of each node in your cluster](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.2.0/installing/prep_cluster.html){: external} into the `/etc/hosts` file on each node.

- [IPv6 is not supported by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.2.0/getting_started/known_issues.html#ipv6){: external}. To avoid problems with the DNS service in an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private cluster, disable the IPv6 settings in the `/etc/hosts` file on each node by commenting out the following line with a `#` sign at the beginning of the line:
  ```
  #::1  localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
  ```
  {:codeblock}

## Resources required
{: #icp-console-setup-resources}

Ensure that your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private system meets the minimum hardware resource requirements for the console and the components you create. The number of vCPU/CPUs that are required can vary depending on your infrastructure, network design and performance requirements. An approximation of your vCPU/CPU requirements can be made by examining the [default resource allocations table](/docs/services/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-saas-pricing#ibp-saas-pricing-default) for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, although the allocations are slightly different in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private. Your actual resource allocations are visible in your blockchain console when you deploy a node.

**Notes:**  

- A vCPU is a virtual core that is assigned to a virtual machine or a physical processor core if the server is not partitioned for virtual machines. You need to consider vCPU requirements when you decide the virtual processor core (VPC) for your deployment in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private. VPC is a unit of measurement to determine the licensing cost of {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} products. For more information about scenarios to decide VPC, see [Virtual processor core (VPC)](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS8JFY_9.2.0/com.ibm.lmt.doc/Inventory/overview/c_virtual_processor_core_licenses.html){: external}.
- A vCPU is equivalent to one CPU, which is equivalent to one VPC.

### Storage considerations
{: #icp-console-setup-storage-considerations}

The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Helm chart uses dynamic provisioning to provision the storage that will be used by the console and the blockchain components you will create. Before you deploy the console, you need to create a storageClass with a sufficient amount of backing storage for your console and your components. You need to provide the name of the storageClass you created during configuration.

- If you use the default settings, the Helm chart will create a new Persistent Volume claim with the name of Helm release for your console data.
- If you use NFS v2/v3 Persistent Volumes, you must enable the **NFS status monitor for NFSv2/v3 Filesystem Locks** module, which is also known as **rpc-statd**, on the host system where the NFS file system exists. This module allows your NFS file system to check for exclusive locks on files that other processes hold. Run the following commands to enable this module:

  ```
  sudo systemctl enable rpc-statd
  ```
  {:codeblock}

  ```
  sudo systemctl start rpc-statd
  ```
  {:codeblock}

## Installing {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private
{: #icp-console-setup-install}

Complete the following steps to install and set up {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private in your environment.

1. Install an [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.2.0/kc_welcome_containers.html){: external} cluster at v3.2.0.

2. Install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private CLI [3.2.0](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.2.0/manage_cluster/install_cli.html){: external} to install the Helm chart.

3. Create a new, custom namespace for your {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform deployment. Note that you can only deploy one Helm chart per namespace, so if you want multiple instances of the console to run on the same cluster, be sure to use separate namespaces.

4. Setup the security and access policies for the target namespace. Instructions are provided in the [next section](#icp-console-setup-psp).

After you install {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private and bind a pod security policy to a target namespace, you can continue to [import the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private Helm chart](/docs/services/blockchain/howto/console-helm-install.html#console-helm-install) into your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private cluster.

## PodSecurityPolicy Requirements
{: #icp-console-setup-psp}

The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Helm chart requires specific security and access policies be bound to the target namespace prior to installation. Use the following steps to configure the policies prior to configuration of the Helm Chart:

1. Choose either a predefined PodSecurityPolicy for your namespace, or have your cluster administrator create a custom PodSecurityPolicy for you:
  - You can use the predefined PodSecurityPolicy of [`ibm-privileged-psp`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-psp)
  - You can also create using YAML below a Custom PodSecurityPolicy definition:

    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: PodSecurityPolicy
    metadata:
      name: ibm-blockchain-platform-psp
    spec:
      hostIPC: false
      hostNetwork: false
      hostPID: false
      privileged: true
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: true
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
      seLinux:
        rule: RunAsAny
      supplementalGroups:
        rule: RunAsAny
      runAsUser:
        rule: RunAsAny
      fsGroup:
        rule: RunAsAny
      requiredDropCapabilities:
      - ALL
      allowedCapabilities:
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE
      - CHOWN
      - DAC_OVERRIDE
      - SETGID
      - SETUID
      volumes:
      - '*'
    ```
    {:codeblock}

2. Create a ClusterRole for the PodSecurityPolicy.
  - If you created a custom security policy, you can create a ClusterRole using the YAML file below:

    ```
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRole
    metadata:
      annotations:
      name: ibm-blockchain-platform-clusterrole
    rules:
    - apiGroups:
      - extensions
      resourceNames:
      - ibm-blockchain-platform-psp
      resources:
      - podsecuritypolicies
      verbs:
      - use
    - apiGroups:
      - ""
      resources:
      - secrets
      verbs:
      - create
      - delete
      - get
      - list
      - patch
      - update
      - watch
    ```
    {:codeblock}

  - If you are using a predefined PodSecurityPolicy, you only need to create a ClusterRole using the second apiGroups section:

    ```
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRole
    metadata:
      annotations:
      name: ibm-blockchain-platform-clusterrole
      rules:
      - apiGroups:
      - ""
      resources:
      - secrets
      verbs:
      - create
      - delete
      - get
      - list
      - patch
      - update
      - watch
    ```
    {:codeblock}

3. Create a custom ClusterRoleBinding. If you decide to change the ServiceAccount name in the file below, you need to provide the name to the `Service account name` field in the **All Parameters** Section of the configuration page when deploying the Helm chart.

  ```
  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: ClusterRoleBinding
  metadata:
   name: ibm-blockchain-platform-clusterrolebinding
  roleRef:
   apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
   kind: ClusterRole
   name: ibm-blockchain-platform-clusterrole
  subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: default
    namespace: default
  ```
  {:codeblock}

You can complete the following steps to use YAML files to bind security and access policies to your namespace:

1. Save the YAML file to your local system.

2. Log in to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private cluster and select the target namespace of your deployment.

  ```
  docker login <cluster_CA_domain>:8500
  ```
   {:codeblock}

3. Use the following command to apply the policy to the target namespace:

  ```
  kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml
  ```
   {:codeblock}

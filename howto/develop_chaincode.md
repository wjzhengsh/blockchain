# Writing smart contracts
{: #develop-smart-contracts}

Chaincode, also referred to as smart contracts, is software that you can use to read and update data on the blockchain ledger. Chaincode can turn business logic into an executable program that is agreed to and verified by all members of the blockchain network. Business logic includes the definition of assets that are traded between parties. It also consists of the terms and conditions that are required for a transaction to be executed. Turning these rules into code on a blockchain allow businesses to streamline business processing and auditing and reduce large amounts of manual processing and paperwork.

As an example, imagine that a network of car dealerships, insurance companies, and government regulators decides to use blockchain to track vehicle ownership. The chaincode might require that all vehicles have a valid registration and vehicle identification number in order to be added to the network. When a vehicle is sold, the chaincode requires that the funds are placed in escrow until the vehicle is registered to its new owner by a regulator. After the new registration completes, the new owner is recorded and the funds are transferred automatically.

The following tutorial will take you through the basic aspects of building chaincode, including:

## Writing chaincode
{: #develop-smart-contracts-write}

Chaincode can be written in multiple languages, and the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform supports chaincode written in Go and Node.js. Chaincode allows users query and change data that is stored in the blockchain by using APIs that the Fabric Chaincode interface provides. Data on the blockchain is stored in key-value pairs in the world state of the channel [ledger ![External link icon](../images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/ledger/ledger.html "ledger"). Chaincode uses get commands to retrieve values and use put commands to create or update values. Using these basic operations, you can build functions that define the business rules of your network. These functions can be invoked by your applications and surfaced to end users of the network. To continue using the vehicle network example, you can create a function that allows a car dealership to use a `PUT` command to add a car to the ledger if they can provide a valid vehicle ID number.

You can learn how to start writing chaincode by visiting the [Chaincode for developers tutorial ![External link icon](../images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/chaincode4ade.html "chaincode for developers tutorial") in the Hyperledger Fabric community documentation. The tutorial will take you through the construction of a simple chaincode that creates and reads assets and introduces you to which APIs are used in the process. You can also find the chaincode API reference guide for all chaincode languages. There are additional examples in the chaincode folder of the [Fabric samples repository ![External link icon](../images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples "Fabric samples").  

A smart contract is typically able to validate requests, apply the business rules and return a deterministic result. However, there are some situations where either additional facts are required or the business network wants to ensure that the information that the clients provide is true fact. Hyperledger Fabric does not prevent external calls to third-party systems from the smart contracts. However, it is the responsibility of the developer of the smart contract to ensure that the resulting R/W sets are deterministic.

## Installing Chaincode
{: #develop-smart-contracts-install}

Because chaincode provides the structure of transactions on a channel, a chaincode needs to be installed on all the peers joined to the channel that want use the chaincode to update or query the channel ledger. Then, one member of the channel can then instantiate the chaincode on a channel and set the chaincode's endorsement policy. Installation and instantiation of chaincode can be performed by using the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform UI, the Fabric Peer command-line interface, or from a client application by using the [Fabric SDK](/docs/services/blockchain/v10_application.html#dev-app-operate-sdk). If you are using {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, visit the [Deploy a smart contract on the network tutorial](/docs/services/blockchain/howto/ibp-console-smart-contracts.html#ibp-console-smart-contracts) to learn how to deploy a chaincode by using the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console. If you are using Starter Plan or Enterprise Plan, see [Installing, instantiating, and updating a chaincode](/docs/services/blockchain/howto/install_instantiate_chaincode.html#install-instantiate-chaincode) to learn how to deploy a chaincode by using the Network Monitor UI.

## Chaincode and data
{: #develop-smart-contracts-data}

Each channel has only one ledger, and the data on that ledger is partitioned by a unique key and the chaincode that added the key value pair to the ledger. Members can only read or update data on the channel ledger by using the correct key and the associated chaincode. The data that can be accessed by a chaincode is referred to as that chaincode's namespace and all data on the ledger is within the namespace of one chaincode. A chaincode can interact with data outside of its namespace only by using a [cross chaincode transaction](/docs/services/blockchain/howto/develop_chaincode.html#develop-smart-contracts-cross-chaincode) to the chaincode that can access the relevant data.

We can use the fabcar chaincode from the Fabric samples repository as an example of how chaincode interacts with data. The namespace is created when the smart contract is instantiated. Some chaincode accepts a set of key value pair arguments when the chaincode is instantiated and use that data to initialize the namespace. The fabcar chaincode from the Fabric samples repository does not accept any arguments when it is instantiated. For fabcar, you need to add data to the namespace by using the initLedger or createCar function. For instance, passing the argument `{"Args":["createCar",'CAR1', 'Honda', 'Accord', 'Black', 'Tom']}` will make the key value pair of `{Key='CAR1', value={'Honda', 'Accord', 'Black', 'Tom'}}` the fabcar namespace.

Only the fabcar chaincode can change this data. Assume that the user wants to transfer the car to a new owner by using the changeCarOwner function below:
```
func (s *SmartContract) changeCarOwner(APIstub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface, args []string) sc.Response {

	if len(args) != 2 {
		return shim.Error("Incorrect number of arguments. Expecting 2")
	}

	carAsBytes, _ := APIstub.GetState(args[0])
	car := Car{}

	json.Unmarshal(carAsBytes, &car)
	car.Owner = args[1]

	carAsBytes, _ = json.Marshal(car)
	APIstub.PutState(args[0], carAsBytes)

	return shim.Success(nil)
}
```
{:codeblock}

You can invoke the chaincode by using the following arguments:
```
{"Args":["changeCarOwner",'CAR1','Mark']}
```
{:codeblock}

The chaincode then uses the get commands to generate a read set from the chaincode namespace. It uses the put commands to create the transaction write set. The invoking of chaincode also creates a unique transaction ID.
```
TxId = Txid1
Read Set: `{Key='CAR1', value[3]='Tom'}`
Write Set: `{Key='CAR1', value[3]='Mark'}`
```
{:codeblock}

Each endorsing peer with the chaincode installed will simulate the transactions using the read set and the write set. If the simulations by each peer are consistent, the transactions are considered valid and can be committed to the ledger. After the transaction, the fabcar namespace will become `{Key='CAR1', value='Honda', 'Accord', 'Black', 'Mark'}`. Note that the owner has changed from Tom to Mark.

The 1-1 relationship between chaincode and data creates important considerations for developing networks and applications. Chaincode software should be updated by installing a chaincode with the same name and a different version, rather than the use of a new chaincode. This update procedure preserves the chaincode namespace and will allow you to continue to use the existing data. You can also use different chaincode to restrict access to sensitive data, or read and write data in parallel.

## Cross chaincode transactions
{: #develop-smart-contracts-cross-chaincode}

You can use a chaincode to invoke other chaincodes. This allows a chaincode to query and write to data outside of its namespace. Chaincode can both read and update data by using chaincode that is instantiated on the same channel. However they can only query data by using chaincode on different channels. The organization that invokes the original chaincode needs to be authorized to invoke the chaincode that is the target of the transaction.

For example, you can use the `crossChaincodeChangeCarOwner` function below to call fabcar from another chaincode. Because the function updates data by changing the car owner, it needs to call a fabcar chaincode instantiated on the same channel.
```
func (s *SmartContract) crossChaincodeChangeCarOwner(APIstub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface, args []string) sc.Response {
	newOwnerArgs := toChaincodeArgs("changeCarOwner", args[0], args[1])

	chaincodeName := "fabcar"
	channelName := "defaultchannel"

	APIstub.InvokeChaincode(chaincodeName, newOwnerArgs, channelName)

	return shim.Success(nil)
}
```
{:codeblock}

If you create a new contract using this code and invoke the function `crossChaincodeChangeCarOwner`, the transaction will generate new a transaction ID and a write set.
```
Contract: newContract
TxId = Txid2
Write Set: `{Key='CAR1', value[3]='Mark'}`
```
{:codeblock}

This TXid and write set will pass to the fabcar chaincode.
```
Contract: fabcar
TxId = Txid2
Read Set: `{Key='CAR1', value[3]='Mark'}`
Write Set: `{Key='CAR1', value[3]='Joe'}`
```
{:codeblock}

Because `fabcar` is on the same channel as `newContract`, the `crossChaincodeChangeCarOwner` function is allowed to write to the `fabcar` namespace. The new `fabcar` namespace will be `{Key='CAR1', value='Honda', 'Accord', 'Black', 'Joe'}`.


## Using indexes with CouchDB
{: #develop-smart-contracts-indexes}

If you use CouchDB as your state database, you can perform JSON data queries from your chaincode against the channel's state data. It is strongly recommended that you create indexes for your JSON queries and use them in your chaincode. Indexes allow your applications to retrieve data efficiently as your network adds additional blocks of transactions and entries in the world state.

For more information about CouchDB and how to set up indexes, see [CouchDB as the State Database ![External link icon](../images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/couchdb_as_state_database.html "CouchDB as the State Database"){:new_window} in the Hyperledger Fabric documentation. You can also find an example that uses an index with chaincode in the [Fabric CouchDB tutorial ![External link icon](../images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/couchdb_tutorial.html). Visit [Best Practices when using CouchDB](/docs/services/blockchain/best_practices.html#best-practices-app-couchdb-indices) in the Developing applications tutorial for more information on how to query data from your applications.

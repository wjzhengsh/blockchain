{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull}} Platform releases a free 2.0 beta, the next generation of {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform solutions that enables you to deploy, operate, and monitor your blockchain network. {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform free 2.0 beta includes a new user interface console, that can be used to deploy and manage blockchain components in your own {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Kubernetes Service cluster on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform free 2.0 beta will allow you to:

**Build your network faster and easier within a seamless experience**

*	Smooth integration between smart contract development (VS Code) and network management
*	Simplified DevOps allows you to move from development to test to production from a single console
*	Support for writing smart contracts in Javascript, Java, and Go languages

**Operate and govern networks with total control**

*	Deploy only the blockchain components you need (peer, ordering service, Certificate Authority)
*	Redesigned console lets you manage network components in one place, no matter where they are deployed
*	Maintain complete control of your identities, ledger, and smart contracts

**Grow distributed networks with ease with newly enabled multi-cloud flexibility**

*	Connect to nodes running in any environment (on-premises, public, hybrid clouds)
*	Easily connect a single peer to multiple industry networks
*	Start small, pay as you grow for what you use with no upfront investment, and upgrade easily through Kubernetes

- More information about the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform free 2.0 beta is available in [About {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform 2.0](/docs/services/blockchain/howto/ibp-console.html#ibp-console-overview).

- The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform free 2.0 beta offering is based on Hyperledger Fabric v1.4 and supports peer-to-peer gossip, service discovery, and private data. Visit this [topic](/docs/services/blockchain/howto/ibp-console-smart-contracts.html#ibp-console-smart-contracts-private-data) to learn how to configure private data on your network.

- The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Visual Studio Code extension is available from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. Developers can use the extension to create, test, and deploy smart contracts to an instance of Hyperledger Fabric. The extension is compatible with Hyperledger Fabric 1.3 and greater. For information about using the VS Code extension, see [Tools for smart contracts](/docs/services/blockchain/vscode-extension.html#develop-vscode).  

The table of contents is enhanced by grouping all getting started topics together into a section called **Getting started tutorials**. Additionally, each of the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform offerings are described in the **About {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform** subsections are now contained under the **LEARN** section.

**Note:** Free cloud credits are no longer available for users of Starter Plan.

## December 7, 2018
{: #whats-new-12-7-2018}

The *Operate Starter Plan Network* and *Operate Enterprise Plan Network* topics are combined and replaced by a single tutorial about [Using the Network Monitor](/docs/services/blockchain/v10_dashboard.html#ibp-dashboard).

## November 27, 2018
{: #whats-new-11-27-2018}

{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform releases {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private is an application platform for developing and managing containerized applications that are based on Kubernetes and it allows users to deploy Certificate Authorities (CAs), orderers, and peers on x86, LinuxONE and IBM Z. {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private is based on Hyperledger Fabric v1.2.1 and is deployed by using Kubernetes Helm charts. After you install the Helm chart, you can find it as a bundled service in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private Catalog. Note that [this offering](/docs/services/blockchain/ibp-for-icp-about.html#ibp-icp-about) is more suitable for experienced Fabric users.

For more information about {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private v3.1.0 documentation ![External link icon](images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_3.1.0/kc_welcome_containers.html "{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private v3.1.0 documentation").

The release of {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private also marks the end of the IBM Blockchain Platform Remote Peer (Beta) program. It is still possible to deploy a peer in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private or in AWS and connect it to an Starter Plan or Enterprise Plan network. For more information, see [deploying a peer against Starter or Enterprise Plan](/docs/services/blockchain/howto/peer_deploy_ibp.html#ibp-peer-deploy) and [deploying a peer in AWS](/docs/services/blockchain/howto/remote_peer_aws.html#remote-peer-aws). These peers are considered to be **distributed** peers instead of remote peers because the deployment is customer managed and as a result there is no central location to be remote from.

This release also debuts some improvements to the documentation table of contents. If you are a Starter or Enterprise user, your content can still be found in the **LEARN**, **HOW TO**, **REFERENCE**, and **HELP** sections, and the links are still the same. It might just be in a different subsection in the table of contents.

## November 13, 2018
{: #whats-new-11-13-2018}

{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform releases {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for Amazon Web Services (AWS).

{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for AWS enables you to run peers in the AWS Cloud and connect the peers to existing blockchain networks in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. Your peers in AWS can leverage the connection profile and other blockchain components in the existing networks, while giving you more flexibility to colocate your peers with other applications outside {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. For more information, see [About {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for Amazon Web Services](/docs/services/blockchain/howto/remote_peer_aws.html#remote-peer-aws).

## October 4, 2018
{: #whats-new-10-4-2018}

{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform upgrades Starter Plan from Hyperledger Fabric v1.1.0 to v1.2.1. For more information, see [About Starter Plan](/docs/services/blockchain/starter_plan.html#starter-plan-about).

**Important:** Fabric v1.2.1 is currently not compatible with the Remote Peer beta, which uses a v1.1.0 peer. Starter Plan networks, which are created before October 4, 2018 and are based on Fabric v1.1.0, are not impacted and can still be used with the Remote Peer beta. {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform will update the Remote Peer beta to use the v1.2.1 peer, which will be compatible with new Starter networks, which are at Fabric v1.2.1 level, and Enterprise networks, which are at Fabric v1.1.0 level. Until the Remote Peer beta is updated to Fabric v1.2.1, do not attempt to deploy a v1.1.0 remote peer with a new v1.2.1 Starter network.

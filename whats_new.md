{: #whats-new-5-29-2019}

The second-generation {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull}} Platform, which enables you to deploy, operate, and monitor your blockchain network, becomes generally available. This release includes a new user interface console that can be used to deploy and manage blockchain components in your own {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Kubernetes Service cluster on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

This {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform release includes the following key features:

**BUILD ---- Integrated developer experience**
- **Easily code** your smart contracts in Node.js, Golang, or Java, write client applications using the new {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} VS Code extension, leverage **SDK integration** with the console, and learn from our rich tutorials and samples.
- **Simplified DevOps** allows you to move from development to test to production in a single environment by scaling up your Kubernetes resources to add more components.
- **Up-to-date Fabric key features**. Leverage the latest features of Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.1:
  -  [Raft ordering service ![External link icon](../images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/orderer/ordering_service.html#raft "Raft ordering service")]
  - **{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service integration.** Leverage the built-in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services, such as {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Kubernetes Service Dashboard, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Log Analysis with LogDNA, and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM).
  - [**Private data** collections](/docs/services/blockchain/howto/ibp-console-smart-contracts.html#ibp-console-smart-contracts-private-data) that provide increased data privacy by ensuring that ledger data is shared to only authorized peers via the gossip protocol.
  - [Service Discovery ![External link icon](../images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/discovery-overview.html "Service discovery"), allowing you to dynamically discover and update how your application interacts with your network.
  - [Channel Access Control Lists ![External link icon](../images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/access_control.html "Access Control Lists") that allow you additional control the governance of your channels and smart contracts.

**OPERATE --- Total control of your deployments**
- **Deploy only the components you need**. Connect a peer to multiple channels and networks, or host an ordering service that business partners can connect to.
- **Maintain complete control of your identities**. Store and manage the keys that are used to administer your nodes without storing your private keys on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
- **Centralized operation**. The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console allows you to deploy and manage all of your organizations and nodes in **one central console** without having to rely on {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} or other vendors to manage your orderers or Certificate Authority. You can also add or remove members from a blockchain consortium, create and join channels, and install and instantiate smart contracts from your console.
- **Host or join a network**. Deploy peers hosted in your cluster to multiple channels on multiple clouds, or invite other organizations to join your consortium or channels while the organizations manage their nodes independently across infrastructures.
- **Manage access** of the users who can administer or monitor your nodes.
- **Direct access to the logs** of your nodes from the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Kubernetes service. Use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Log Analysis service or a third-party service to extract and analyze your logs.
- **Interact directly with your pods** using the Kubernetes Dashboard. Exec into your pods and containers to execute commands and update certificates from the command line.
- **Dynamic signature collection** that allows better control over collaborative governance over channel configurations.

**GROW --- Scalability and flexibility**
- **Choose your compute**. You have the flexibility to decide the amount of CPU, memory, and storage you want to provision in your Kubernetes cluster. For more information, see [How the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Kubernetes Service interacts with the console](/docs/services/blockchain/howto/ibp-console-govern.html#ibp-console-govern-iks-console-interaction).
- **Scale** up and down the resources in your Kubernetes cluster, paying for only what you need. For more information see [Pricing](/docs/services/blockchain/howto/pricing.html#ibp-pricing).
- **Disaster recovery and multi-zone high availability.** This option duplicates your Kubernetes deployment across zones, enabling high availability (HA) of your components and disaster recovery (DR).
- **Run Anywhere** (instructions coming soon). Thanks to the **unified codebase** of the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console, it is possible to run your components on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private, and third-party public clouds.

## December 7, 2018
{: #whats-new-12-07-2018}

The *Operate Starter Plan Network* and *Operate Enterprise Plan Network* topics are combined and replaced by a single tutorial about [Using the Network Monitor](/docs/services/blockchain/v10_dashboard.html#ibp-dashboard).

## November 27, 2018
{: #whats-new-11-27-2018}

{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform releases {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private is an application platform for developing and managing containerized applications that are based on Kubernetes and it allows users to deploy Certificate Authorities (CAs), orderers, and peers on x86, LinuxONE and IBM Z. {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private is based on Hyperledger Fabric v1.2.1 and is deployed by using Kubernetes Helm charts. After you install the Helm chart, you can find it as a bundled service in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private Catalog. Note that [this offering](/docs/services/blockchain/ibp-for-icp-about.html#ibp-icp-about) is more suitable for experienced Fabric users.

For more information about {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private v3.1.0 documentation ![External link icon](images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_3.1.0/kc_welcome_containers.html "{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private v3.1.0 documentation").

The release of {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private also marks the end of the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Remote Peer (Beta) program. It is still possible to deploy a peer in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private or in AWS and connect it to a Starter Plan or Enterprise Plan network. For more information, see [deploying a peer against Starter or Enterprise Plan](/docs/services/blockchain/howto/peer_deploy_ibp.html#ibp-peer-deploy) and [deploying a peer in AWS](/docs/services/blockchain/howto/remote_peer_aws.html#remote-peer-aws). These peers are considered to be **distributed** peers instead of remote peers because the deployment is customer managed and as a result there is no central location to be remote from.

This release also debuts some improvements to the documentation table of contents. If you are a Starter or Enterprise user, your content can still be found in the **LEARN**, **HOW TO**, **REFERENCE**, and **HELP** sections, and the links are still the same. It might just be in a different subsection in the table of contents.

## November 13, 2018
{: #whats-new-11-13-2018}

{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform releases {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for Amazon Web Services (AWS).

{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for AWS enables you to run peers in the AWS Cloud and connect the peers to existing blockchain networks in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. Your peers in AWS can leverage the connection profile and other blockchain components in the existing networks, while giving you more flexibility to colocate your peers with other applications outside {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. For more information, see [About {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for Amazon Web Services](/docs/services/blockchain/howto/remote_peer_aws.html#remote-peer-aws).

## Installing the extension
{: #develop-vscode-installing-the-extension}

1. Navigate to the [Visual Studio Code extension marketplace page ![External link icon](images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBMBlockchain.ibm-blockchain-platform) or search for **{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform** in the extensions panel within Visual Studio Code.
2. Click **Install**.
3. Restart Visual Studio Code to complete installation of the extension.

## Visual Studio Code command palette
{: #develop-vscode-command-palette}

This extensions adds many commands to the Visual Studio Code command palette. Many of the operations detailed in this document can also be started by running the command from the Visual Studio Code command palette.

## Creating a project
{: #develop-vscode-creating-a-project}

To create a new project, complete the following steps:

1. Open the command palette, run the **Blockchain: Create Smart Contract Project** command.
2. Select the language you wish to create a smart contract in, currently the options are JavaScript or TypeScript.
3. Create a folder with the name of your project, and open it.
4. Select how to open your new project. The project folder should now open.

## Connecting to and disconnecting from a network
{: #develop-vscode-connecting-and-disconnecting}

When you use this extension, you install and instantiate smart contract packages on peers and channels in your Hyperledger Fabric instance. This extension can initialise a preconfigured local instance of Hyperledger Fabric using Docker.

### Connecting to the preconfigured Hyperledger Fabric instance
{: #develop-vscode-connecting-to-preconfigured-Fabric-instance}

To connect to the preconfigured Hyperledger Fabric instance, first ensure Docker is running on your machine:

1. Open the **{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform** tab in Visual Studio Code.
2. In the **{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform** pane, click **local_fabric**. If Docker is running, the local Hyperledger Fabric instance should be downloaded and started.
3. After the local Hyperledger Fabric instance has been started, double click **local_fabric** to connect to it. You should now see a channel called `mychannel`.

#### Restarting the preconfigured Hyperledger Fabric runtime
{: #develop-vscode-restarting-Fabric-runtime}

To restart the `local_fabric` runtime:

1. Right-click on the `local_fabric` connection when it is established.
2. Select **Restart Fabric Runtime**.

The Hyperledger Fabric containers will be stopped and restarted.

#### Teardown the Hyperledger Fabric runtime
{: #develop-vscode-teardown-Fabric}

To teardown the `local_fabric` runtime:

1. Right-click on the `local_fabric` connection when it is established.
2. Select **Teardown Fabric Runtime**.

Performing a teardown of the `local_fabric` network will close all Hyperledger Fabric containers. **Please note**: This will result in the loss of the ledger and world state data.

#### Enabling development mode on the preconfigured Hyperledger Fabric runtime
{: #develop-vscode-enabling-development-mode-Fabric}

In normal operation, a peer will create and maintain a chaincode container to run instantiated smart contracts. By switching to development mode, the peer allows the chaincode container to be run manually. Running the chaincode container manually, on the command line or in a terminal, assists with iterative development and debugging of smart contracts.

To enable development mode with the preconfigured Hyperledger Fabric runtime:

1. Right-click on the `local_fabric` connection when it is established.
2. Select **Toggle Development Mode**.

Development mode must be enabled in order to use the debugging feature of the extension.

## Exploring connections
{: #develop-vscode-exploring-connections}

After connecting to a Hyperledger Fabric instance, you can see a list of the available channels and peers in those channels in the **{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform** pane. Spend a minute exploring your Hyperledger Fabric instance to get familiar with the structure. Listed first are the channels within a connection, under a channel is a list of the peers that are members of that channel, and a list of smart contract packages instantiated on that channel. Under each peer in the list is a list of all smart contract packages installed on that peer. You can also see the versions of smart contract packages that are installed or instantiated.

### Exporting connection details for the preconfigured Hyperledger Fabric runtime
{: #develop-vscode-exploring-connection-details}

The connection details required to connect to the `local_fabric` connection can be exported. Connection details for the `local_fabric` connection are useful for testing client applications intended to connect to or interact with your Hyperledger Fabric instance.

To export the `local_fabric` connection details:

1. Start the preconfigured Hyperledger Fabric runtime.
2. Right-click on the `local_fabric` connection, and select **Export Connection Details**.

The connection details are saved to a directory called `local_fabric` contained in your current project directory.

## Packaging a smart contract
{: #packaging-a-smart-contract}

When a smart contract is ready to be deployed, it must first be packaged. To package a smart contract, complete the following steps:

1. In Visual Studio Code, navigate to the **{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform** panel.
2. In the **Smart Contract Packages** pane, click the + icon. If you have a smart contract project open in the file viewer, it will be automatically packaged, and will be shown in the **Smart Contract Packages** pane. If you have multiple smart contract folders open, you will be asked which one to package. If you have no smart contract folders open, you'll get an error message.

## Installing smart contract packages
{: #develop-vscode-installing-smart-contract-packages}

After connecting to an instance of Hyperledger Fabric, you can install and instantiate smart contract packages on the peers.

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform pane, navigate to the peer you wish to install the smart contract package on.
2. Right-click the peer to install the smart contract package on, and select **Install Smart Contract**.

## Instantiating smart contract packages
{: #develop-vscode-instantiating-smart-contract-packages}

To begin running on a channel, an installed smart contract package must first be instantiated.

1. Connect to the Hyperledger Fabric instance where the smart contract package is installed.
2. Right-click on the channel you wish to instantiate the smart contract package on and click **Instantiate Smart Contract**.
3. Select the smart contract package and version to be instantiated. The smart contract package must be installed on a peer that is a member of this channel.
4. Enter the name of the instantiate function in your smart contract.
5. Enter any arguments required by your instantiate function.

## Exporting or deleting a smart contract package
{: #develop-vscode-exporting-deleting-smart-contract-package}

After a smart contract has been packaged, it can be exported as a `.cds` file or deleted if it is no longer needed.

To delete a smart contract package:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform extension panel, right-click the smart contract package to delete.
2. Select **Delete Package**.

The package will now be deleted and disappear from the list of smart contract packages.

To export a smart contract package:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform extension panel, right-click the smart contract package to export.
2. Select **Export Package**.
3. Choose the directory to save your smart contract package file and click **Export**.

## Testing an instantiated smart contract
{: #develop-vscode-testing-instantiated-smart-contract}

Tests for a smart contract can be generated after the smart contract has been instantiated. The tests can be generated as either JavaScript or TypeScript, and run or debugged.

To generate smart contract tests:

1. Ensure that the smart contract has been instantiated.
2. Under **Instantiated Smart Contracts**, right-click on the smart contract to generate tests for.
3. Select **Generate Smart Contract Tests**.
4. Now select the language for the test file, either **JavaScript** or **TypeScript**. The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform extension will now install required npm modules and build the test file.

After the test file has been built, the tests can be run by clicking the **Run Tests** button in the file.

## Debugging a smart contract using the preconfigured Hyperledger Fabric runtime
{: #develop-vscode-debugging}

The ability to debug a smart contract locally helps a smart contract developer to iterate on their smart contract functions, and fix bugs before attempting to invoke the functions after instantiation. Debugging a smart contract allows you to run through the smart contract transactions with breakpoints and output, ensuring the transactions work as intended. To debug your smart contract:

1. Ensure you are connected to the `local_fabric` connection that it is in development mode.
2. Open your smart contract project.
3. Open the debug view in Visual Studio Code using the left-hand navigation bar.
4. Select the Debug Smart Contract configuration by using the dropdown in the upper-left.
5. Package and install the smart contract by clicking the **play** button.
6. Add breakpoints to the smart contract by clicking on the relevant line numbers in your smart contract files.
7. Right-click on the installed smart contract and select **Instantiate**. You can now right-click to submit transactions and the execution will be paused on defined breakpoints.

To make changes to your smart contract while debugging, click the **restart** button after making the changes to your smart contract. Restarting debugging means you don't need to instantiate the contract again.

**Please note**: Restarting debugging stores the smart contract in local memory, for a large number of changes to large smart contracts, you may need to reinstantiate the smart contract.

## Upgrading an instantiated smart contract
{: #develop-vscode-upgrading-instantiated-smart-contract}

After a smart contract has been installed on a peer and instantiated on a channel, it can be upgraded to deploy a newer version of the smart contract.

1. Ensure that the smart contract you wish to upgrade is instantiated.
2. Install the new version of the smart contract to a peer on the same network.
3. Right-click on the instantiated smart contract, and select **Upgrade Smart Contract**.
4. Optionally, choose a transaction to run after the new smart contract is instantiated.

## Submitting transactions
{: #develop-vscode-submitting-transactions}

After a smart contract has been installed and instantiated, the transactions can be submitted from the connections pane in the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform extension panel.

To submit a transaction:

1. Ensure that your smart contract is installed and instantiated, and that you're connected to the network.
2. In the connections pane, expand the **Instantiated Smart Contracts**.
3. Expand the smart contract that contains the transaction to be submitted.
4. Right-click on the transaction to submit, and select **Submit Transaction**.
5. Enter any arguments required by the transaction, and press **Enter**.

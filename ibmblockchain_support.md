{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull}} Platform provides several avenues for troubleshooting problems and getting support, which depend on the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform offerings that you use.
{:shortdesc}

For all {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform offerings, it is recommended to firstly use [free digital support resources](/docs/services/blockchain/ibmblockchain_support.html#blockchain-support-resources) to troubleshoot problems and get help from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} and the Hyperledger Fabric Community. If you use a Starter or Enterprise plan network, you can navigate to the "Support" screen in your Network Monitor, which contains links to these resources.

If your problem cannot be solved by any of the [free digital support resources](/docs/services/blockchain/ibmblockchain_support.html#blockchain-support-resources), consider the following approaches to get support for the offerings that you use.
- **Starter Plan and Enterprise Plan on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}**
  Submit a support case though {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. For more information, see [Submitting support cases](/docs/services/blockchain/ibmblockchain_support.html#blockchain-support-cases).

- **{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform free 2.0 beta**
  Submit a support case through {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. **Support will be limited during the Beta period.** For more information, see [Submitting support cases](/docs/services/blockchain/ibmblockchain_support.html#blockchain-support-cases).

- **{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Visual Studio Code extension**
    Submit any issues in the [{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Visual Studio Code extension](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/blockchain-vscode-extension/issues "{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Visual Studio Code extension").

- **{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private**
  If you have purchased an {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private license and you want to contact customer support, see [Accessing the IBM Support Community and opening a support ticket ![External link icon](images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ibm10740041 "{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private Support").

  For issues that are related to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private, you can take advantage of [both free digital support and paid support from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private ![External link icon](images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/fe25b4ef-ea6a-4d86-a629-6f87ccf4649e/entry/Learn_more_about_IBM_Cloud_Private_Support?lang=en_us "IBM Cloud Private Support").

- **{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Community Edition**
  The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Community Edition is intended for exploration, development, and testing. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} does not provide support for the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Community Edition.

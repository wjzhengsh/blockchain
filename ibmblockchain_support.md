# Getting support
{: #blockchain-support}

{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull}} Platform provides several avenues for troubleshooting problems and getting support, which depend on the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform offerings that you use.
{:shortdesc}

For all {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform offerings, it is recommended to firstly use [free digital support resources](/docs/services/blockchain/ibmblockchain_support.html#blockchain-support-resources) to troubleshoot problems and get help from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} and the Hyperledger Fabric Community. If you use a Starter or Enterprise plan network, you can navigate to the "Support" screen in your Network Monitor, which contains links to these resources.

If your problem cannot be solved by any of the [free digital support resources](/docs/services/blockchain/ibmblockchain_support.html#blockchain-support-resources), consider the following approaches to get support for the offerings that you use.

- **Starter Plan and Enterprise Plan on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}**
  Submit a support case through {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. For more information, see [Submitting support cases](/docs/services/blockchain/ibmblockchain_support.html#blockchain-support-cases).

- **{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform beta trial**
  Submit a support case through {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. **Support will be limited during the beta period.** For more information, see [Submitting support cases](/docs/services/blockchain/ibmblockchain_support.html#blockchain-support-cases).

  If you have purchased an {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private license and you want to contact customer support, see [Accessing the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Support Community and opening a support ticket](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ibm10740041){: external}.

  For issues that are related to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private, you can take advantage of [both free digital support and paid support from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/fe25b4ef-ea6a-4d86-a629-6f87ccf4649e/entry/Learn_more_about_IBM_Cloud_Private_Support?lang=en_us){: external}.

- **{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Community Edition**
  The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Community Edition is intended for exploration, development, and testing. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} does not provide support for the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Community Edition.

- **{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for AWS**
  {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} does not provide support for this offering and will not respond to support cases that are opened in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and are related to {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for AWS.

  For issues that are related to AWS, you can use both [community support forums](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/index.jspa){: external} and [AWS premium support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/){: external}.

- **Starter Plan and Enterprise Plan on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}**
  Submit a support case through {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. For more information, see [Submitting support cases](/docs/services/blockchain/ibmblockchain_support.html#blockchain-support-cases).

  <!--[placeholder] Starter Plan and Enterprise Plan are deprecated on May 30. No new Starter Plan and Enterprise Plan networks can be created then. Your existing networks are not affected, but you can use them and get IBM's support on them for only another 30 days. You might consider using {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform free 2.0 beta instead.

The response to your support case depends on your [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} support plan](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/get-support/index.html#support-plans){: external}.

- If you have purchased **Premium Support** or **Advanced Support**, you can specify a severity level on your ticket from Sev-1 to Sev-4. Sev-1 is the highest level of severity. Support cases with higher severity levels indicates more urgency and will be responded to more quickly by the support team. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} support plan offerings](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/get-support/index.html#support-plans){: external}.  
- If you do not purchase support, your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account comes with a free **Basic Support** plan. In this case, your support case will automatically be registered Sev-4.
<!--
**Beta offerings** are provided with more limited support than Generally Available releases.

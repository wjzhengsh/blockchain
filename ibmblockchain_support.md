# Getting support

***[Is this page helpful? Tell us.](https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/4501493/IBM-Blockchain-Documentation)***

{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull}} Platform (IBP) provides several avenues for troubleshooting problems and getting support, which are associated with the IBP offerings that you use.
{:shortdesc}

For all IBP offerings, it is recommended to firstly use [free digital support resources](#resources) to troubleshoot problems and get help from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} and the Hyperledger Fabric Community. If you use a Starter or Enterprise plan network, you can navigate to the "Support" screen in your Network Monitor, which contains links to these resources.

If your problem cannot be solved by any of the [free digital support resources](#resources), consider the following approaches to get support for the offerings that you use.
- **Starter Plan and Enterprise Plan on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}**
  Submit a support case to {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}. For more information, see [Submitting support cases](#support-cases).
- **IBP for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private (ICP)**
  If you have purchased an IBP for ICP license and you want to contact customer support, see [Accessing the IBM Support Community and opening a support ticket ![External link icon](images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ibm10740041 "{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for ICP Support").
- **{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Community Edition**
  The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Community Edition is intended for exploration, development, and testing. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} does not provide support for the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Community Edition.

  For issues that are related to ICP, you can take advantage of [both free digital support and paid support from ICP ![External link icon](images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/fe25b4ef-ea6a-4d86-a629-6f87ccf4649e/entry/Learn_more_about_IBM_Cloud_Private_Support?lang=en_us "IBM Cloud Private Support").
- **{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for AWS**
  {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} does not provide support for this offering and will not respond to support cases that are opened in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and are related to IBP for AWS.

  For issues that are related to AWS, you can use both [community support forums ![External link icon](images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/index.jspa "AWS community support forums") and [AWS premium support ![External link icon](images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/ "AWS premium support").

## Resources and support forums
{: #resources}

**{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Service docs**
[{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Service docs](index.html), which is this doc site, provides guidance on how to start with IBP. You can find corresponding topics from the left navigator or search any term with the search function on the top.

**{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} dWAnswers**
[{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} dWAnswers ![External link icon](images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/smartspace/blockchain/ "Questions and answers in the Blockchain space") is a community forum for users of IBP and Hyperledger Fabric, which is monitored by experts from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} among others. You can search for answers to previously posed questions or submit a new question. Be sure to include the keyword **blockchain** in your new question.

**Sample applications**
[Sample applications ![External link icon](images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/ibm-blockchain "IBM Blockchain sample applications") under **Blockchain sample applications** provides guidance and sample code snippets to assist in the development of applications.

**Hyperledger Fabric resources**
[Hyperledger Fabric documentation ![External link icon](images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "Hyperledger Fabric"), the [Fabric community wiki ![External link icon](images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric "Fabric community wiki"), and the [Fabric Jira dashboard ![External link icon](images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10104 "Fabric Jira dashboard") provide more details about the Fabric stack.

You can also talk to a Fabric expert in [Rocket.Chat ![External link icon](images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric "Fabric Rocket.Chat channel") to get answers to questions about Fabric.

**Hyperledger Composer resources**
Because {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} does not provide support for using Hyperledger Composer for production implementation, you are encouraged to engage with [Hyperledger Composer community ![External link icon](images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/composer "Hyperledger Composer community") and [Stack Overflow ![External link icon](images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hyperledger-composer "Stack Overflow questions tagged [hyperleder-composer]") when you work on demos and proofs of concept.

## Submitting support cases
{: #support-cases}

For issues that are related to Starter or Enterprise Plan, you can submit a support case in the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Service Portal ![External link icon](images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://ibm.biz/ibmcloudsupport "IBM Cloud Service Portal").

**Note:** If you need help with Hyperledger Fabric chaincode, Hyperledger Composer, or your applications, please make use of the community resources above or engage [{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Services ![External link icon](images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/services "Turn your blockchain strategy into business outcomes with {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Services"). It is recommended to use Hyperledger Composer solely for demos and proofs of concept. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} does not provide support for networks using Hyperledger Composer in production, including the Composer CLI, JavaScript APIs, REST server, and Web Playground.

The response to your support case depends on your [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} support plan ![External link icon](images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/get-support/index.html#support-plans "Support Plans").

- If you have purchased **Premium Support** or **Advanced Support**, you can specify a severity level on your ticket from Sev-1 to Sev-4. Sev-1 is the highest level of severity. Support cases with higher severity levels indicates more urgency and will be responded to more quickly by the support team. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} support plan offerings ![External link icon](images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/get-support/index.html#support-plans "Support Plans").  
- If you do not purchase support, your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account comes with a free **Basic Support** plan. In this case, your support case will automatically be registered Sev-4.

Follow these steps to submit a support case.

1. Log in to [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Service Portal ![External link icon](images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://ibm.biz/ibmcloudsupport "IBM Cloud Service Portal") with your {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} ID.
